A reddit clone with facebook-like chat and notifications.  
This was my first ASP.NET MVC application back in 2018.  
During the development proccess the code had been rewritten countless times since  
I was new to asp.net and even now there are things I wish I could have done different.  
Still, it was my first fairly big project and I'm proud of it.
